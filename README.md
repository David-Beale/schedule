# Viral Culture

Project submission for the 2020 EUvsVirus Hackathon.

## The problem your project solves

Our team has assembled to tackle the issue of low accessibility to cultural events, which have now moved online in response to the outbreak. 

Live events are streamed on a daily basis, but there are no efficient tools to help artists or cultural organisations spread the word about their work. 

Similarly, it is extremely difficult for users to find relevant content, as YouTube or Twitch algorithms favour large streamers who are skilled in the use of key words, or already have large audiences.

## The solution you bring to the table

We have developed a web based application, designed to give every content creator an equal opportunity to reach their target listener. 

Our platform lists a schedule of cultural events posted by the content creators, in a way that is visually appealing and simple to understand. Each event has a link to the page from which the content is streamed, so that logged in users may simply watch that stream on our page.

Anyone using the page can search for an event using a dedicated search bar, and then save a selected event in their calendar (Google Calendar, iCal or Outlook Calendar). 

The broadcast schedule has a 24-hour time span. We wanted to give it a familiar feel, so it is designed in a fashion that is known from online TV Guides.

Each event card includes a link to the content creator’s Patreon account, enabling direct financial support.

A huge advantage of our app is that any stream url from any large streaming service can be embedded into our platform. 

## What you have done during the weekend

- Implemented secure login with 3rd party providers (Google, Facebook)
- Created an infrastructure for adding and deleting events
- Included the ability to view streamed content inside event cards
- Added links to content creator’s Patreon
- Built a system for sending calendar invites for specific events
- Made various styling and UI changes
- set up extremely flexible and highly scalable serverless infrastructure for interacting with the database

## The solution’s impact to the crisis

Our platform significantly reduces time and complexity of online marketing to customers seeking high quality cultural events.

It helps content creators forge deeper and more intimate relationships with their viewers, who will be prompted not just to receive the content, but also to support the creator financially.

This direct relationship is a win-win for both sides - the creators will get the reach they deserve, while users will have fine-grain control over the content they watch. 

## The necessities in order to continue the project

We have a tonne of great ideas, which we will be able to implement and further explore with help from an experienced mentor, preferably someone with online marketing experience. 

We could also use some help from graphics and UI designers, who would work alongside us to create a top-notch user experience.

Last but not least, we would really appreciate being connected to a network of online influencers or up-and-coming artists, who will be quick to see the value in our application and help us further promote it online.

## The value of your solution(s) after the crisis

It goes without saying that the current events are forever going to change how we work and interact with each other. 

Now is a perfect time for content creators who had not yet moved online to finally take that step. We can help them seize this unique opportunity, such that they are not left behind in this quickly changing world.

We believe our platform will continue to grow in relevance, because the relationship between content creators and users can no longer be limited to interaction in person - having a strong online presence will be a make or break for millions of artists.
